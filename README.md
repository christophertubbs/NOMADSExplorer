# NOMADSExplorer
Library for looking through, discovering, and loading NetCDF data in the National Water Model NOMADS file structure

The URL for NOMADS is: https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/nwm/prod/

Only two days of data are stored at a time, but this library needs to be able to look for more.
